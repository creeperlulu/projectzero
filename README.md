# Project Zero
A game made using the Sprig engine for the Sprig console by Hack Club!

You're a robot in a laboratory. What are you doing here? Who put you there? And most importantly, why are you awake only now, while you're alone in this laboratory?
Solve the puzzles to progress through the rooms and solve the mysteries of this lab, while you try to get to your goal: escaping this place.

# How to run
Simply go to https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/Project_Zero to see the project as it was submitted to the Gallery, or you can also copy the contents of index.js and paste that in the Sprig editor for the **always up-to-date version**.
